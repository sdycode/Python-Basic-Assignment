        "CSV is a format for saving tabular information into a delimited text file with extension .csv whereas Excel is a spreadsheet that keeps files into its own proprietary format viz xls or xlsx.\n",
        "CSV is a plain text format with a series of values separated by commas whereas Excel is a binary file that holds information about all the worksheets in a workbook.\n",
        "CSV file can’t perform operations on data while Excel can perform operations on the data.\n",
        "Comparing CSV vs Xlsx, CSV files are faster and also consumes less memory whereas Excel consumes more memory while importing data.\n",
        "Comparing CSV vs Excel, CSV files can be opened with any text editor in windows while Excel files can’t be opened with text editors.\n",
