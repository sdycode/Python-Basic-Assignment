1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*       : expression
'hello' : value
-87.8   : value
-       : expression
/       : expression
+       : expression
6       : value

2. What is the difference between string and variable? 
--> string is data type which stores value in form of sequence of characters which are mutable, whereas variable is entity which refered as name for any data container

3. Describe three different data types. : 
--> 
     1. int : stores numerical value which came in category of integer among real with no limit
     2. tuple : it is sequence type data type which store list of heterogenous data sperated by comma
     3. dictionary : data stored in key-value pair format where value can be accessed using key

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
--> Expressions are value representitive enitites which are made up of identifiers, literals, and operators.
    Expressions are used to represent or reuse of values, which are very useful to perform any complex task.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement? 
--> statements are used to perform any task using expressions, operators, variables etc.
    statement never represent any value, but operations can be performed on these values using statements

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1 
--> bacon will have value = 22, as in 2nd line expression is given but NOT statement, so new value is NOT assigned

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'  =  spamspamspam
'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam
-->  
'spam' + 'spamspam'  =  spamspamspam
'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
-->    In python Variable name should start with letter(a-zA-Z) or underscore (_). 



9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value? 
--> 1. str(value) 
    2. int(value) 
    3. float(value)

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
--> As string can be concatinated with string only NOT string
    It can be fixed using str() function 
    'I have eaten ' + str(99)+ ' burritos.'
